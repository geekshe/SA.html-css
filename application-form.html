<!--Directions
Part 1: HTML

Add to the HTML document application-form.html so that it has the following items.

    A form that asks the user:
        their first and last name (as separate fields),
        their salary requirement as a number, and
        which job they are applying for, from a list of:
            Software Engineer
            QA Engineer
            Product Manager
    The form should also have a submit button that submits the form to the URL path /application-success. This should be a POST request. (For now, just focus on the HTML requirements for this request. Don't build a Flask route, yet.)
    The page should have a large heading and some explanatory text, as well.
    Add the elements to make your HTML form accessible to screen readers. For more information, see http://webaim.org/techniques/forms/controls.

Part 2: CSS

Open the CSS file, styles.css, and use this to stylize the HTML file, application-form.html.

First, edit the HTML file to reference the CSS file. Then, complete each of the following styles using CSS:

    Change the background color of all of the form input boxes and submit button to be yellow. (Can you do this for all input boxes without having to stylize each one independently?)
    Change the text in the last name field to be bold.
    Draw a border around the instruction box.
